## Project: Spice Garden Restaurant - Develop Interactive Order Processing Pages

### Context

The "Spice Garden" restaurant had garnered quite a reputation for its delectable and custom-made variety of dishes. It wasn't just the flavors that set The Spice Garden apart; it was their unique approach to customer service.

At The Spice Garden, patrons could place an order for any dish of their choice by simply calling the restaurant. Whether it was a mouthwatering cheese burst pizza or a plate of sizzling noodles, the customers had the freedom to customize their orders to their heart's content. This personalized approach had diners raving about the restaurant far and wide.

To make the ordering process even more convenient, the restaurant decided to embrace modern technology. They developed a user-friendly web application that allowed their call operators to streamline the process. With this application, the operators could easily access the restaurant's menu, enter order details on behalf of the customers, and crucially, persist this information for future reference.

In essence, the restaurant aimed to create a digital system that not only enhanced their customer service but also enabled them to better understand their clientele's preferences and history.

The goal was clear: to develop a JavaScript program that would be the backbone of this system, giving The Spice Garden's call operators the tools they needed to continue providing their patrons with the exceptional, personalized dining experience they had come to expect.

Tools used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js


Steps to Run

Locate your project folder:
Navigate to the folder where your Spice Garden Restaurant project is stored.

Open the project files:
Open the main HTML file (typically named index.html) in your text editor to ensure everything is correctly linked (CSS, images, JS, etc.).

Run the project:
Directly in the browser:
Right-click the index.html file and select Open with > [Your Browser].
Using a local server (optional for more advanced setups):
Start the local server (e.g., using XAMPP or WAMP).
Place the project folder inside the server's root directory (e.g., htdocs for XAMPP).
Access the project in the browser at http://localhost/YourProjectFolder.

Verify responsiveness:
Resize the browser window or use the developer tools (Ctrl+Shift+I or F12) to check how the project adapts to different screen sizes.

Test functionality:
If you have interactive features like a reservation system or navigation menu, test these components thoroughly to ensure they work as expected.

Fix any issues (if needed):
If you encounter broken links, missing images, or layout issues, review the code and resolve the errors.
